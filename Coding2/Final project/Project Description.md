## Final Project
# Project Description
# Final Work: Personal Art Exhibition- AI Artist "Alloy-X"
## _________________________________________________________
#### An interesting online exhibition dedicated to AI-created artwork.

## Concept
### An interesting online art exhibition. The theme of the exhibition is called: Impressions of London. Each piece shows the artist's feelings about London from his perspective, using a different way of painting. Interestingly, the author of these works is not a human, but the AI artist Alloy-X. Feel free to explore the space and experience the difference these special works can make for your visual enjoyment.

## Inspiration
### I have been worried about the content of my final work this semester. I have learnt a lot of basic computer knowledge and libraries, but I do not have a concrete, complete form of work that I can interact with the audience. This is when I learned about GANS, a new class of deep generative models that have been proposed in recent years for their ability to synthesize new samples by capturing rich data such as audio, images, or video (Saxena & Cao, 2021). This has led to significant developments in the art of artificial intelligence. Coincidentally, my dissertation research for my critical thinking course also happens to be related to AI Artist. The question I explored was whether artworks created by humans and artworks created by AI should be judged under the same criteria, provided that the identity of the creator of the artwork does not affect its artistic value. So, I decided to organize an online exhibition directly for the AI, so that they could hold their own solo exhibitions just like real human artists. It would also complement my research by allowing the audience to participate and get a real feel for whether the artwork created by the AI has the same artistic value, so that people can experience the enjoyment of the artwork.

## Technology and Interactive Mode
## Techniques
#### 1. Firstly, the "Fast Style Transfer for Arbitrary Styles" technique in python is used to generate many different styles.
#### The "Fast Style Transfer for Arbitrary Styles" technique is used to generate many different styles.
#### 2. Build a basic A-Frame interactive scene using MIMIC.

## Interactive Mode
1. Long press the mouse on the screen to rotate the space 360 degrees.
2. "W", "A", "D" and "S" on the keyboard can respectively control the image to move up/left/right/down.
3. The audience watching on the mobile phone can rely on the gravity sensor to watch the scenery in the space.
4. The background music is automatically played when loading out of the interface. And the sound level will be changed according to the fixed position of the code. When the audience is far away from the scene, the music becomes less sound. When the audience approaches the scene, the music becomes louder.
5. Some objects in the space will float slightly through the programming language, creating a dreamy atmosphere.

## Summarize
### After browsing this online exhibition of AI artists, the audience participated in a questionnaire survey. Of these, 69.82% of the participants thought that the artworks created by the AI artist had artistic value. It had a very important impact on my subsequent research.

## 1.	Difficulties:
### 1)  Because of the need to create the work in conjunction with the research paper, time was very tight in the production process. Many technical difficulties have in fact not yet been solved.
### 2)  The scenes were not rich enough and the AI artist's work was relatively homogeneous in form.

## 2.	Expectation:
## Future project development
### I hope that I can delve further into GANS depending on my interests. 
### Eventually I can generate different types of ai artists' works in different ways to enhance the audience's sensory experience.
