### Dio the Sculpture is the work of New York artist Ben Snell. It is named Dio as tribute to the Greek god of wine Dionysus. 
### It is made by using GANs, 3D printing, and other new technologies collaboratively, 
### which also marks the first time applying GANs to the creation of sculptures.

### Ben Snell first collected the three-dimensional data of more than 1,000 classical sculptures 
### (including classic works such as Discus Thrower and Michelangelo's David, and Samothrace's Wings of Victory), 
### and then generated a picture of a smooth, humanoid standing posture using GANs.” 
### The author built a 3D model based on this picture, 3D-printed a Dio mold.

### and then took apart his computer (including the casing, hard drive, etc.) 
### and grounded them into powder. Then the computer powder and resin are put into the mold. When they were solidified, 
### the creation is completed.

### Ben Snell believes that the materials used by sculptors of different eras represent their different eras. 
### Dio is a sculpture of our era, which is made of computer's original materials to represent the characteristics of the current era.
### Meanwhile, the data and computers used to create Dio have become part of the work, making the work non-reproducible.
