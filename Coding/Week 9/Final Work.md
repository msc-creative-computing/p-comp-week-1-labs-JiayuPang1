#### **Final Work**
## **Christmas DreamWorks**
----------
#### *It is an exploration of 3D scene and VR interaction*

### Preface
------
#### Undergraduate is a graphic design major, and I am interested in three-dimensional design and interaction design. However, due to the lack of knowledge reserves, when I entered the postgraduate course of CCI, especially the coding course, every new knowledge was a new difficulty for me.

####Finally, this assignment mainly used Aframe for 3D modeling, dynamic effects, and VR interaction between the scene and the audience. Overall, the simple operation of Aframe gave me some confidence in myself. Although the current works still look very immature. But the exploration in these two weeks has brought me a lot.

#### The courses in the previous few weeks also allowed me to learn a lot of experience and came into contact with many interesting programming effects and methods. I hope that this knowledge can be integrated with the in-depth exploration in the future.

###Source of inspiration
-------
#### After reviewing the learning content of the previous few weeks, I found that I was still more interested in 3D content. So I finally decided to focus on the formation of 3D graphics through computer language. In the final course, the teacher also shared with us Aframe, which is very easy to use for beginners. So I decided to use it to present the final work.

###Concept
------
#### Christmas is coming soon, and I hope to create a dream space free from outside interference. Everything here is concrete but different from the real and complex reality. I hope that when the audience enters the link and interacts with the scene, they can temporarily forget the unpleasantness of life and the heavy emotions in their hearts. They can feel more pure and dreamy power deep in their hearts.

### Interactive Mode
--------
#### 1. Enter the media interface and the program starts to run.
#### 2. Long press the mouse on the screen to rotate the space 360 degrees.
#### 3. "W", "A", "D" and "S" on the keyboard can respectively control the image to move up/left/right/down.
#### 4. The audience watching on the mobile phone can rely on the gravity sensor to watch the scenery in the space.
#### 5. The background music is automatically played when loading out of the interface. And the sound level will be changed according to the fixed position of the code. When the audience is far away from the scene, the music becomes less sound. When the audience approaches the scene, the music becomes louder.
#### 6. Some objects in the space will float slightly through the programming language, creating a dreamy atmosphere.

###Summarize
-----------
#### 1.	Difficulties:

#### · The understanding of programming language is not deep enough. Although I have solved some problems that have arisen, many ideas cannot be successfully executed when they are written into code.

#### · The learning of programming language needs to be strengthened, and the content that can be displayed at present is still simple and lacks originality. I hope that with the improvement of my technical and professional level, more good ideas can be realized.

#### 2.	Expectation:
#### ·Although the final work did not fully meet my expectations. But in the process of doing homework, by investigating various websites, codes, and watching some teaching videos, these have helped me quickly improve my ability. I also have more interest and confidence in the coding course. Finally, I hope that I can continue to work hard to improve my professional skills during the short vacation and have a better performance in the next semester.
