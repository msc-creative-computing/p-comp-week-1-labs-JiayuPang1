## Code


`int led = 9;`

`int brightness = 0;`

`int fadeAmount = 5;`

```
void setup()
{
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}
```
```
void loop()
{
  analogWrite(led, brightness);
  
  brightness = brightness + fadeAmount;
  
  if (brightness <= 0 || brightness >= 255) {
    fadeAmount = -fadeAmount;
  }
  
  delay(10);
}
```

# Lab 04: Feedback systems
-------

## 路 Introduction of the Lab04 Practice

#### **The LED is controlled by two sensors**

###### *路 One is the NPN phototransistor*

###### *路 The other is the distance sensor*



#### Only when two conditions are met at the same time: first one, the external environment is dark, second, the distance between the object and the LED is within the specified range, the LED will be bright. 
#### My understanding of feedback made by machinery itself is: machinery will perceive changes in the external environment and give different feedback. They seem to be conscious. As for the emergence of machinery consciousness, I think the essence is to let them have perception, that is, to add various sensors to them.


###### *路 But unfortunately, I don't know how to make these two sensors control the LED at the same time. Now they can only work separately, one can control the LED on and off. One can only measure the distance between the object and the LED. Maybe someone can help me.

--------------
#### This induction mode is very easy to apply in life and work. 
#### For example, we can design an interactive light chain that follows the movement of the audience.
