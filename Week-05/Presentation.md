#### *- In the past，The war, colonization and slavery are the products of dehumanization, making people have no self-consciousness and work and live just as machines and beasts.*

#### *After the Industrial Revolution, With the emerge of advanced science and technology, lots of machines that can liberate human labor ,but… human beings still cannot get rid of the boring work like machine.*

#### *- I am not against the combination of man and machine, but I am very concerned about the boundary between man and machine*
#### *In fact，the concept of dehumanization is gradually permeating our lives and our view of the world.*
#### *- Whether it’s post-humanism in the 20th century or the currently popular works combining humans and machines, and the cyber-theory, yes, the cyber-manifesto that we have read not long ago.*
#### *so, I think we must not be taken lightly.*

#### *- I want to make a mechanical device that interacts with people, people can control it, there are rules for entertaining the audience, and it will feed back a lot of interesting information. But in fact, the machine has its own set of rules to monitor human behavior.*
#### *- Both sets of rules are carried out at the same time.*
