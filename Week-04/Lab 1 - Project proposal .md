## WEEK 04

# Project proposal
-------

#### I want to explore the boundary between human and machine.
#### In fact, I think:
#### There has never been a clear boundary between us and the machine.

## · Inspiration：
----------

#### *- In the past* ：The war, colonization and slavery are the products of dehumanization, making people have no self-consciousness and work and live just as machines and beasts.

#### *- After the Industrial Revolution* ：With the emerge of advanced science and technology, lots of machines that can liberate human labor, but… human beings still cannot get rid of the boring work like machine.

#### *- Nowdays* ：Many people live without any aims and repeat the work day by day, walking forward along the same track of life just as a machine without thoughts.

#### I am not against the combination of man and machine, but I am very concerned about the boundary between man and machine.
#### In fact，the concept of dehumanization is gradually permeating our lives and our view of the world.

#### Whether it’s post-humanism in the 20th century or the currently popular works combining humans and machines, and the cyber-theory, yes, the cyber-manifesto that we have read not long ago.
#### So, I think we must not be taken lightly.


## Idea：
-----------

#### I want to make a mechanical device that interacts with people, people can control it, there are rules for entertaining the audience, and it will feed back a lot of interesting information. But in fact, the machine has its own set of rules to monitor human behavior. Both sets of rules are carried out at the same time.

#### When people finish interacting with the first screen and turn to the other side, they will find the real intention of the machine.
#### In this way, we hope to trigger people's thinking. 
#### ~~? Is the surface you see real ?~~
#### ~~? Who is controlling whom ?~~
